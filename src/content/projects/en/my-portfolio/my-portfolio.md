This project is my current portfolio, where you are right now! I built it by focusing on SEO, performance and design. The user experience, characterized by the fluidity, design and accessibility, was essential. I used Astro for this website, implemented a light and dark theme, used the SolidJS library for the dynamic elements and Three.js for the header animation. Of course, an easter egg is hidden somewhere!
