This project is simply my current portfolio, where you are right now! I built it by focusing on SEO, performance and design. The user experience, characterized by fluidity, design and accessibility, was paramount. I used Astro for this website, implemented a light and dark theme, and used the SolidJS library for the dynamic elements and Three.js for the header animation. Of course, an easter egg is hidden somewhere!
