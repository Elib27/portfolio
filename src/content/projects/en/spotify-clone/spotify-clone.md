This project is a reproduction of the Spotify website. The features and design being already defined for this site, I was able to focus on their implementation. I used the Next.js framework for development. The major challenges were the management of the interaction with the Spotify API via a server state manager: React Query, the client-side state management with Redux Toolkit, the creation of the music player as well as the authentication, carried out with NextAuth.
