Welcome to my site, in my own world! I am a freelance web <span class="highlight">developer</span> with a passionate relationship for code, started in my childhood with Arduino and its hacks. Since 2018, I have been cultivating my interest in web development, always striving to combine aesthetics, functionality and <span class="highlight">performance</span> in each of my projects.

My skills extend over a wide range of tools and technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, or even Astro, to which I actively <span class="highlight">contribute</span> in open source.

My philosophy includes a responsive design for an optimal user experience, an obsession with web performance and a commitment to <span class="highlight">accessibility</span> for all.

If you are looking for a web developer who combines technical expertise, creativity and commitment, you have come to the right place!
