This project is an AI playing othello game. The goal is to have more pieces on the gameboard than your adversary at the end of the game. I used SolidJS to handle the dynamic part and Typescript for the game logic. The AI is based on the minimax algorithm, written in C and compiled to WASM for optimal performances. The algorithm is executed on a web worker to not slow down the page while calculating the next move. You can try it yourself by playing a game and choosing the AI level!
